  <p><b>Background:</b> German propaganda displayed the Soviet Union as the center of the alleged Jewish
    conspiracy to take over the world. The presentation of the USSR changed significantly as the war started to go
    badly for Germany.</p>

        <b>Caption:</b> "Winter Relief in Russia"
      </p>
      <p>
        The <i>Winterhilfswerk</i> was the Nazi Party charity to provide assistance for those in need in winter. This
        cartoon suggests that the Soviets have a program as well: shipping people to Siberia.

        <b>Caption:</b> “Soviet espionage by children.” The young lad says: “I’m turning in my father. He has
        something against Stalin.”
      </p>
      <p>The Soviets did actually did glorify a 13-year-old boy named <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavlik_Morozov">
          <b>Pavel Morozov</b></a> who allegedly put loyalty to the state above loyalty to his family, although
        much of the story seems an invention of Soviet propaganda.

        <b>Caption:</b> "Too late!"
      </p>
      <p>A Jew is preparing the Soviet bear for an attack on Germany, but before he can get the attack going Germany
        takes
        action. This was published just after the invasion of the Soviet Union began. It supported the Nazi claim that
        Hitler had acted just in time to prevent a Soviet assault not only on Germany, but on all of Europe.</p>

        <b>Caption:</b> "The threat from the steppes."
      </p>
      <p>This appeared just after the defeat at Stalingrad. The Soviets are no longer portrayed as an easily defeated
        bear.</p>
